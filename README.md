## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm senior software engineer at [Qonto](https://qonto.com/) AI Lab, based in Italy, with a passion for fintech, algorithmic trading, and quantitative finance.
I primarily work on proprietary software that manages millions of users and billions of dollars, focusing on scalability, performance, and reliability.
When I can, I try to spend some of my free time contributing to open-source projects.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, Go, Typescript, Scala, Dart
- **Frameworks & Tools:** FastAPI, React, Flutter, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Docker, AWS, and more

### Open-source Projects 
- while I was working at [Alpaca Markets](https://alpaca.markets/) I contributed to the development of [alpaca-py](https://alpaca.markets/sdks/python/) mainly using my [corporate profile](https://github.com/alessiocastrica?tab=overview&from=2023-12-01&to=2023-12-31) and sketched out an example broker integration [backend](https://github.com/Ale-Cas/alpaca-partner-backend) and [frontend](https://github.com/Ale-Cas/alpaca-broker-react)
- At [InvestSuite](https://www.investsuite.com/) I developed a lightweight library called [querytyper](https://github.com/investsuite/querytyper) to build MongoDB queries using [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) models
- I also worked on [optitrader](https://github.com/Ale-Cas/optitrader) a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) dashboard that lets you optimize a portfolio of US stocks and invest on it using [Alpaca's Trading API](https://alpaca.markets/algotrading)
